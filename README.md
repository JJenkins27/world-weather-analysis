# World Weather Analysis

Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, matplotlib, and APIs to analyze weather and maps for vacation planning

## Overview of Project

An analysis of weather and mapping data to provide assistance in vacation planning, including current weather data, nearest hotel information, and intinerary planning.

### Purpose

PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company that specializes in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack, the head of analysis for the user interface team, has asked for help in collecting and presenting data for customers via the search page. The customer will input their preferred travel criteria and the results will show the ideal hotel anywhere. Information gathered will be via APIs to OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps to present heat maps and hotel information for preferred vacation criteria.
